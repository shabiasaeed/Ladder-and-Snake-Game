//COMP249  
//Assignment #1 
Due Date (08-FEBRUARY-2021)*/
// The program starts with a welcome message and the objective of the assignment is to create a Ladder and Snake game that asks the user to input number of players( between 2-4) and then let each player flip a dice.Depending on number value of dice they get the game determines the order with player
//getting largest value of dice being the first player and the player with the smallest value of dice being the last one who plays the game with a descending order. In case if there is a tie between any of players then they have to roll the dice again to determine among them who plays the first
//and then once order is determined , players start the game with that order and they roll the dice every time and it iterates every time and their position  inside that border gets updated if player 3 for example is initially at position 5 and gets a current dice value of 4 then the new position  player 3 
// becomes 9 being the total sum of previous dice values. The game continues until one of the players jumps or reached the position 100 of that board. If meanwhile throughout the game any of the players hit a position where there is ladder it will climb to the top of the ladder and get in a much higher position.
// on the other hand if the player hits a position where there is tip of the head of the snake then the players climbs or goes down below at the tip of snake's tail. The positions of ladders and snakes are preset and fix as they are determined from the beginning of the program.If in any case any of the players rolls a dice
// any the sum of the value of the dice + their previous position's value exceeds 100 then they start to go backwards with the exceed amount for example if any player is at position 95 and gets a roll dice value of 6 then 95+6=101 the exceed value is 1 after 100 so the player actually goes back from 100-1 =99 sets the position 99 as new 
//since it can't go to a position such as 101 or after.  The program terminates with a closing message after it declares the winner of the game.
